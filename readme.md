# Overview
The Smart Fridge Food Recommender is a mobile application that uses YOLOv5, an object detection model to identify foods inside a refrigerator, fetches their nutritional information, and recommends meals based on the userâ€™s macronutrient goals. This project aims to provide a convenient way for users to manage their diet and make informed food choices.
